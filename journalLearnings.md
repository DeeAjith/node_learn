  - Why use node.js?
  - History of node.js. -> Node.js was written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009. Now it is maintained by the Node.js Foundation.
  - node.js vs browser. -> node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side. e.g. Printed Welcome to node world!! on browser.
  - Running node.js code. -> created index.ts file & used http module to create a server.
  - Modules. -> created log.ts file & used it in index.ts.
  - Creating & importing -> imported log.ts file in index.ts used logInfo function to log messages.
  - \[global\] keyword. -> In browsers we have window object but in node.js we have only top-level scope in same module.
